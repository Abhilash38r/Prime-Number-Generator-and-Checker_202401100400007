# Prime-Number-Generator-and-Checker-:

# 📊 Prime Number Generator and Visualization Using Dataset

## 🚀 Project Description
This project is designed to **generate random numbers from a dataset**, **check for prime numbers**, **visualize the distribution of prime and non-prime numbers** using graphs, and also allow user input to check whether a number is prime or not. Additionally, the project provides an option to export prime numbers to an **Excel file**.

The primary goal of this project is to enhance understanding of **prime numbers** and their statistical distribution using a dataset. It uses Python libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** to process and visualize data, providing a clear insight into how prime numbers behave within a dataset.
